# Minecraft-Auto-Miner
This smol Lua program enables automatic mining in Minecraft through the [CC:Tweaked mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-tweaked) for v1.12.2
                 
To use it, run the program on a Mining Turtle's prompt as "MiningProgram <X> <Y> <Z>" and replace X, Y and Z with
how big of an area you want it to mine. <Z> is used to tell the turtle how deep to mine.
  
### How do I get it on the Mining Turtle in the first place?:
* Simply put the .lua file in `.minecraft/mods/ComputerCraft/lua/rom/programs`
* It should now be accessible on all your turtles

### Some useful features:
* The turtle will automatically come back up once it is done
* It throws out junk like cobblestone, stone (diorite, andesite and granite) and dirt automatically so they dont waste space
* If it runs into bedrock it will automatically come back up
* It refuels on its own and the fuel can be placed into any slot in the turtle. The turtle needs 12 fuel to start (coal/charcoal)
      
Enjoy! :D
